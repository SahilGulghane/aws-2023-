socks proxy is basically proxy server between cilent and actual server where cilent and proxy server is connected via ssh protocol 
forming tunnel the tunnel is very secure stack of encryption there are the types of socks (version)

1 socks-4 support only udp protocol
2 socks-4a
3 socks-5 support both udp and tcp protocol 

_____The main difference between vpn and socks is that there is no secure tunnel between proxy server and cilent one can contact to vpn  service to reveal 
ip address 


what is tcp protocol -> Transmission control protocol it gives gurantee between reciver and sender nolosss of data will they have three steps of handshake 
1 syn 
2 syn and ack
3 ack 

what is udp protocol -> user datagram protocol it does not give gurantee to recive 100% data
